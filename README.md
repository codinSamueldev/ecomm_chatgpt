# Shoes website
Hi there! I am Samuel and this a basic ecommerce website. The main purpose of this website was to test the abilities of *chatGPT* creating the basic structure and styles of a shoes ecommerce website (Yap, needs way a lot of other essential sections, but keep this between us :tw-1f605:). 

### I must admit...
It was fun, not only when something went wrong, but also the specific way you have to create the prompt so you can get the result you want.

**Last but not least**, you can give it a look in the following link: https://codinsamueldev.github.io/ecomm_chatgpt/

Without further ado, `have a nice day!` no matter when you are reading this :tw-1f609:
